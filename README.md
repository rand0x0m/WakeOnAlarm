# WakeOnAlarm

Simple alarm clock that wakes your pc up using Wake On Lan (WOL). Please consider adding your computer's
MAC address in the main activity on line 17 (MainActivity.java:17). And your network's broadcast address
on Magic Packet class (MagicPacket.java:43).

Feel free to report any issues or any patches for them.

### TODO

Fix memory leaks with static context fields.

##### Although project's license allows it, I highly don't recommend the use of this app in any production environment.
